Initialize the clusters and number of iterations
Finding the distances
For each iteration starting from 0	
Calculate the distance of each point with clusterheads
Find the min distance cluster
Assign the point into that cluster
Assign the cluster with cluster index
Recalculate the new cetroids
Generate cluster groups and assignment groups for points
